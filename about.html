	<p>                                       I am Sourav Hasan, a dedicated computer science student at East West University in Bangladesh. My academic journey is fueled by a profound passion for technology, with a particular focus on web development and competitive programming.

        As a student of Computer Science and Engineering, I have the privilege of delving deep into the world of algorithms, data structures, and cutting-edge software development. I find immense satisfaction in gaining a comprehensive understanding of these core concepts and applying them to real-world scenarios.
        
        My enthusiasm for web development knows no bounds. Crafting websites allows me to blend creativity with technical expertise, turning ideas into visually appealing and user-friendly online experiences. I thrive on the process of coding, designing, and optimizing websites, and I constantly explore new technologies to stay at the forefront of this dynamic field.
        
        Competitive programming is another dimension of my academic journey that I wholeheartedly embrace. It presents an exciting challenge, demanding precise problem-solving and algorithmic skills. The competitive aspect fuels my desire to improve and excel, making it an area where I continuously push my boundaries.
        
        East West University has provided me with the foundation and resources to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas. With a robust background in computer science and a fervent interest in web development and competitive programming, I look forward to contributing to the tech industry and embracing the opportunities that lie ahead
